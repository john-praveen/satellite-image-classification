# Satellite Image Classification

**Author:** Praveen V.V.J  

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify satellite images into four land cover classes. The model is trained on the Satellite Image Classification Kaggle dataset and performs multi-class classification on preprocessed satellite images.

## About Remote Sensing

Remote sensing involves acquiring information about the Earth's surface using satellites or aerial sensors. Classifying satellite images into categories such as cloud, desert, green area, and water is important for environmental monitoring, land use analysis, and resource management.

## About the Dataset

**Dataset Name:** Satellite Image Classification  
**Link:** [Kaggle - Satellite Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification)

**Content:**  
- Images collected from various sensors and Google Maps snapshots.  
- Four classes:  
  1. Cloud  
  2. Desert  
  3. Green area  
  4. Water  
- Preprocessing is applied to normalize and standardize images before feeding them into the CNN.
